## Homework 1: Adversial mindset

### Summary 

- Long history for exploiting network vulnerabilities
- APT = Advanced persistent Threat
  - Meant for compromising data for economic or military advancement
  - Protection against the threats with best practices of enterprise level patching and hardening and reducing the most easily accessible vulnerabilities in nwtworked services
   - APT actors use advanced tools, malware and zero-day exploits
  - APT modelling is unique, but other phase based models to defensive and countermeasure strategies exist
   - ie. modelling IED attacks

- CND = Computer Network Defence
 - Base security decisions and measurements on understanding the adversary
 - Intelligence-driven CND is a risk management strategy 
   > that addresses the threat component of risk, incorporating analysis of adversaries, their capabilities, objectives, doctrine and limitations
 - The basic idea is that in a kill chain model just one mitigation may thwart the adversary -> repetition by adversary must be recognized and leveraged by the defender
 
- Actions against kill chain 
 1. Detect
 2. Deny
 3. Disrupt
 4. Degrade
 5. Deceive
 6. Destroy
