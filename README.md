## Homework 2

## Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 2 - Protocol Building Blocks

Schneier (2015) talks about one-way functions which he considers to be central tp pub-key cryptography. They are not protocols but building blocks for protocols in cryptography.

Schneier uses a metaphor of plates as one-way functions: they are easy to break into pieces but not easy to fix back into a plate-form. He goes on that one-way functions alone are not practical for encryption for the same reason:
You can't write a message to a plate, smash it to million pieces and expect something to construct it back together.

As a solution Schneier presents trapdoor one-way function where you need a secret so that you can solve the encryption. Using another metaphor: disassembling a watch into hundreds of pieces and putting it back together is hard. However if you have secret (assembly instructions) it is possible to put the watch back together.
